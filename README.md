# TaskMaster Pro - Personal Task Manager

## Overview

TaskMaster Pro is a responsive web application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks and to-do lists. This project represents my exploration into modern web development using core web technologies without external frameworks, focusing on creating a practical, user-friendly application that demonstrates fundamental web development concepts.

The application allows users to create, organize, and track tasks with features like due dates, priority levels, and completion status. All data is stored locally in the browser, ensuring privacy and instant access without server requirements.
